# Let's Play Bingo

## About

This is a simple 3x3 bingo card generator that you can use on a tablet (e.g. iPad) to play bingo.

When you load a wordlist, if you click on the `QR` button, you can have the students scan the QR code to make their own bingo sheet.

Students can drag the tiles from the right on to the bingo grid, or click the 'Random' button to automatically generate a card.

## Wordlists

These wordlists have pictures associated with them, which makes them nice to use with bingo:
