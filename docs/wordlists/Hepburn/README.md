# Hepburn

These are wordlists that correspond to words in English that also use hepburn romaji.

## Notes

The idea behind these wordlists are to get students writing using hepburn romaji instead of kunrei-shiki.

**Important**: Because these words are supposed to be practicing hepburn romaji, we don't accept alternatives such as `tenpura` (note the `n` instead of `m`).
